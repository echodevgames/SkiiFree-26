01/2026 Using Unity (Version 6.0000.3.1f1)

Created as a case study to disect the old SkiiFree '91 game and make an emulation.
Designed to demonstrate the ability to use Unity to emulate a classic style video game.
The classic system actually moved a player and it's camera across a pre existing map.
This new system moves spawned objects across the viewport after spawning them below it,
and destroys them when they reach a destroy zone of the top of the screen.
The system is current incomplete as of 1-26-2026, This is just the first build.
